# Module: Production Planning (PP) - Implementation Blueprint

## 1. Module Overview

The Production Planning module provides a comprehensive suite of tools for planning, scheduling, executing, and monitoring manufacturing processes. It bridges the gap between sales orders, inventory levels, and shop floor operations.

**Key Features:**
-   Visual Production Scheduling
-   Shop Floor Data Collection & Execution
-   Bill of Materials & Routing Management

## 2. Current Status

-   **Progress:** 0%
-   **Status:** **Not Started**
-   **Summary:** No frontend components or specific planning files for the PP module have been created. This document is the first step in the development process.

## 3. Phase 1: Core Component Implementation (To-Do)

### üìã Task: Build Production Planning Board
-   **Status:** ‚è≥ To-Do
-   **Description:** Create a Gantt chart-based interface for visual scheduling.
-   **Requirements:**
    -   [ ] **Gantt View:** Display production orders and operations on a timeline against resources (machines, work centers).
    -   [ ] **Drag & Drop Scheduling:** Allow planners to move and resize operations to adjust the schedule.
    -   [ ] **Capacity View:** Visualize resource load and highlight potential bottlenecks.
    -   [ ] **Dependency Lines:** Show relationships between different production operations.
    -   [ ] **Component:** `components/production-planning-board.tsx`

### üìã Task: Build Shop Floor Terminal
-   **Status:** ‚è≥ To-Do
-   **Description:** Create a touch-optimized interface for operators on the manufacturing floor.
-   **Requirements:**
    -   [ ] **Work Order Display:** Show the current work order, operation details, and work instructions.
    -   [ ] **Data Entry:** Allow operators to confirm quantities (good, scrap), track time, and report issues.
    -   [ ] **Real-time Updates:** Display live progress bars and production KPIs.
    -   [ ] **Document Viewer:** Allow access to technical drawings and quality documents.
    -   [ ] **Component:** `components/shop-floor-terminal.tsx`

### üìã Task: Build Bill of Materials (BOM) Editor
-   **Status:** ‚è≥ To-Do
-   **Description:** Create an interface for managing complex, multi-level Bills of Materials.
-   **Requirements:**
    -   [ ] **Tree Structure:** Visualize the BOM in a hierarchical, collapsible tree.
    -   [ ] **Version Management:** Allow comparison between different BOM versions.
    -   [ ] **Cost Rollup:** Calculate and display the total cost based on component prices.
    -   [ ] **Where-Used Analysis:** Find all parent assemblies a component is used in.
    -   [ ] **Component:** `components/bill-of-materials-editor.tsx`

## 4. Phase 2: Advanced Features & Integration (Backlog)

-   [ ] **AI-Powered Scheduling:** Develop an engine to suggest optimal production schedules based on constraints.
-   [ ] **Real-time Machine Monitoring:** Integrate with IoT sensors to display live machine status on the shop floor terminal.
-   [ ] **MRP Integration:** Create a workflow to automatically generate production orders from Material Requirements Planning runs.
-   [ ] **Quality Management Integration:** Embed quality check forms directly into the shop floor terminal.
