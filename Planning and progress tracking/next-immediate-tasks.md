# Next Immediate Tasks: Financial Management (FI) Module Audit

**Focus Area:** Financial Management (FI) Module Audit & Enhancement Planning  
**Last Updated:** 2025-08-14

With the Human Capital Management (HCM) module confirmed as 100% complete, our full attention shifts to the Financial Management (FI) module. While its initial scope is complete, a thorough audit is required before planning Phase 2 enhancements.

This process will be conducted systematically, component by component.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Phase 1: Comprehensive Module Audit (Action Required)**

**Objective:** To meticulously review each of the 10 components in the Financial Management module, verifying functionality, code quality, UI/UX consistency, and backend integration points.

**Component Audit Checklist:**
1.  [x] **Chart of Accounts (`ChartOfAccounts.tsx`)** â€” useApi wiring with mock fallback, loading/error, a11y
2.  [x] **Journal Entries (`JournalEntries.tsx`)** â€” useApi wiring with mock fallback, loading/error, a11y
3.  [x] **Accounts Payable (`AccountsPayable.tsx`)** â€” useApi wiring with mock fallback, loading/error, a11y, i18n currency
4.  [x] **Accounts Receivable (`AccountsReceivable.tsx`)** â€” useApi wiring with mock fallback, loading/error, a11y, i18n currency
5.  [ ] **Payment Run Wizard (`PaymentRunWizard.tsx`)** â€” pending validation and export flows
6.  [x] **Collections Management (`CollectionsManagementDashboard.tsx`)** â€” useApi wiring with mock fallback, loading/error, i18n currency
7.  [x] **Three-Way Match (`ThreeWayMatch.tsx`)** â€” useI18n integrated, a11y improvements
8.  [x] **Financial Reporting (`FinancialReporting.tsx`)** â€” useApi wiring with mock fallback, loading/error, i18n currency
9.  [x] **Asset Accounting (`AssetAccounting.tsx`)** â€” useApi, loading/error, i18n currency, POST depreciation
10. [x] **Bank Reconciliation (`BankReconciliation.tsx`)** â€” useApi, loading/error, POST match, a11y

### ðŸ”§ **Phase 2: Backend Integration Validation (After Audit)**

**Objective:** To systematically validate every `// CURSOR: API call to ...` comment within the FI module. This ensures that every frontend action has a clearly defined backend endpoint and that the mock data accurately reflects the expected API schemas.

### ðŸš€ **Phase 3: Enhancement Scoping (Post-Validation)**

**Objective:** To define the roadmap for the next generation of financial features based on the audit findings.

**Potential Features for Scoping:**
-   Advanced Budgeting & Forecasting tools.
-   Comprehensive multi-currency management and FX handling.
-   AI-powered cash flow prediction and anomaly detection.
-   Deeper integration with the Analytics module for real-time financial intelligence dashboards.
