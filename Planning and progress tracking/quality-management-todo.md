**Module Lead:** Lead Frontend Architect
**Status:** Not Started (0% Complete)
**Last Updated:** August 7, 2025

## üìù Module Overview

The Quality Management (QM) module is responsible for ensuring that products meet required quality standards throughout the supply chain. This involves planning inspections, recording quality results, and managing deviations. This plan outlines the features required to build a robust and integrated QM system.

## üöÄ Phase 1: Core QM Foundation (0% Complete)

### ‚úÖ Task 1: QM Dashboard (To Do)
- **Component:** `QualityManagementDashboard.tsx`
- **Description:** A central overview of all quality-related activities and key performance indicators.
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement KPI cards (e.g., First Pass Yield, Defect Rate, Open Notifications).
  - [ ] Create a chart to visualize quality score trends over time.
  - [ ] Display a data table of active inspection lots requiring action.
  - [ ] Show a list of recent quality notifications.

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Inspection Planning Interface (To Do)
- **Component:** `InspectionPlanEditor.tsx`
- **Description:** An interface for quality engineers to define how and when materials are inspected.
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - [ ] Create a form to define a new inspection plan.
  - [ ] Add functionality to link plans to specific materials or vendors.
  - [ ] Create an interface to define quality characteristics (e.g., "Viscosity", "Color Match").
  - [ ] Implement logic for defining sampling procedures (e.g., "Inspect 10% of items").

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Quality Inspection & Results Recording (To Do)
- **Component:** `ResultsRecordingTerminal.tsx`
- **Description:** A streamlined interface for quality technicians to view inspection lots and record results.
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - [ ] Create a master-detail view to list inspection lots and view details.
  - [ ] Implement a form for recording quantitative (e.g., measurements) and qualitative (e.g., pass/fail) results.
  - [ ] Add functionality to make a "Usage Decision" (e.g., Accept, Reject, Rework).
  - [ ] Integrate with inventory to post stock to "Unrestricted" or "Blocked" status based on the decision.

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Quality Notification Management (To Do)
- **Component:** `QualityNotificationManager.tsx`
- **Description:** A system for creating, tracking, and resolving quality deviations.
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - [ ] Create a form to raise a new quality notification (e.g., for a customer complaint or internal defect).
  - [ ] Implement a workflow to assign tasks and track corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).
  - [ ] Create a dashboard to view all open notifications and their status.
