## Architecture & tooling

- Next.js 14.2.16 with App Router (`package.json`)
- TypeScript, Tailwind 3.4, shadcn/ui components (`components/ui/*`)
- RTL/i18n provider and language switcher (`contexts/i18n-context.tsx`, `components/language-switcher.tsx`)
- RBAC and protected route scaffold (`hooks/use-permissions.ts`, `components/protected-route.tsx`)
- SSE prototype for CRM events (`app/api/crm/events/route.ts`)

## Module‑by‑module status (verified)

### CRM
- Dashboard: Implemented with KPIs, funnel, tasks, activity feed.
  - Evidence: `components/crm-dashboard.tsx` calls `/api/crm/dashboard/kpis`, `/api/crm/dashboard/activity-feed`, `/api/crm/dashboard/tasks`, and pipeline `/api/sales/pipeline/opportunities` with graceful fallbacks.
  - Proxy routes exist with fallback data: `app/api/crm/dashboard/{kpis,activity-feed,tasks}/route.ts`, `app/api/sales/pipeline/opportunities/route.ts`.
  - Realtime SSE wired for activity/pipeline updates: `app/api/crm/events/route.ts` consumed by dashboard and opportunities page.
- Entry page: `app/crm/page.tsx` mounts `CrmPageContent`, which renders the dashboard and i18n’ed labels.
- Entities (lists):
  - Leads: List with server params (page, sort, q), bulk status change, saved views (URL + localStorage), column chooser, import/export, CSV template.
    - Evidence: `app/crm/leads/page.tsx`; server handlers `app/api/crm/leads/*` including `bulk-status`, `import`, `import/template`.
    - Tests: `tests/crm-leads.test.tsx` verifies data rendering.
  - Accounts: List with server params, import/export, CSV template; column toggles are not exposed via a menu (no saved views UI here).
    - Evidence: `app/crm/accounts/page.tsx`; routes under `app/api/crm/accounts/*` incl. `import` and `template`.
  - Contacts: List with server params; export; no pagination controls UI and no saved views menu.
    - Evidence: `app/crm/contacts/page.tsx`; routes exist `app/api/crm/contacts/*`.
  - Opportunities: Kanban DnD by stage, realtime update, in‑page forecasting totals.
    - Evidence: `app/crm/opportunities/page.tsx`; stage update route `app/api/crm/opportunities/[id]/stage/route.ts`.
  - Quotes, Orders: List pages implemented with server params; detail routes scaffolded; status badges via i18n keys.
    - Evidence: `app/crm/quotes/page.tsx`, `app/crm/orders/page.tsx`; API proxies exist under `app/api/crm/{quotes,orders}/`.
- i18n: Extensive CRM keys exist in `locales/en/translation.json` (titles, columns, statuses, dashboard labels); Arabic/Norwegian bundles mirror structure.
- RBAC: Pages guard with `ProtectedRoute required="view:sales"`; smoke tests exercise RBAC rendering (`tests/pages-rbac-smoke.test.tsx`).

Status vs CRM to‑dos (cross‑check):
- Milestone 1 (Core Sales Entities):
  - Leads, Accounts, Contacts lists + basic details: DONE (lists verified; detail pages exist; detail content not fully assessed).
  - Opportunities Kanban: DONE (DnD + basic metrics computed client‑side).
  - Quotes, Orders lists: DONE (lists). Detail/fulfillment workflows: PARTIAL/TODO.
- Milestone 2 (UX & Productivity):
  - Global CRM search with saved segments: TODO (global search component exists, not CRM‑scoped segments).
  - Saved views and column chooser: PARTIAL (rich in Leads; lighter/absent on others).
  - Shareable views (URL): PARTIAL (Leads uses URL params `view`/`cols`).
- Milestone 3 (Collaboration & Timeline): PARTIAL (dashboard activity feed + tasks; no per‑entity mentions/attachments flows yet).
- Milestone 4 (Permissions & Realtime): PARTIAL (route guarding achieved; fine‑grained field‑level hiding not implemented; SSE wired for demo).
- Milestone 5 (Data Ops & Integrations): PARTIAL (import/export for Leads/Accounts; file upload service TODO; API_BASE_URL proxy pattern present in routes).
- Milestone 6 (Quality): PARTIAL (unit/integration tests minimal; a11y and perf hardening pending).

### Customer Portal
- UI: Complete multi‑tab experience (Dashboard, Orders with filtering, Invoices, Catalog with search, Support tickets, Account details) with i18n and export/reorder stubs.
  - Evidence: `components/customer-portal.tsx`; mounted at `app/customer-portal/page.tsx` (guarded by `view:sales`).
- Data: Mocked in component; backend integration marked via CURSOR comments.

Status: UI COMPLETE, backend integration pending.

### Reports & Analytics
- Custom Report Builder UI: Implemented with data source/table selection, fields, filters, grouping/sorting, chart/table preview, save/export stubs.
  - Evidence: `components/custom-report-builder.tsx`; mounted at `app/reports/page.tsx`.
- Analytics dashboard page present: `app/analytics/page.tsx` (wraps `AnalyticsDashboard`).

Status: UI COMPLETE for builder; needs real API wiring (listed in planning doc). Treat “production‑ready” claims as UI‑ready only.

### Application shell, RBAC, i18n
- Shell: `AppShell` with sidebar/header/breadcrumbs, notifications panel scaffold.
- RBAC: `ProtectedRoute` + `use-permissions` client map; unauthorized page exists; smoke tests present.
  - Evidence: `components/protected-route.tsx`, `hooks/use-permissions.ts`, `tests/pages-rbac-smoke.test.tsx`.
- i18n: `I18nProvider` and language switcher; CRM and portal copy fully keyed (`locales/*/translation.json`).
  - Evidence: keys such as `crm.*`, `customerPortal.*`, `reports.*` exist in `locales/en/translation.json`.

Status: Shell COMPLETE; RBAC FOUNDATION DONE (server‑driven permissions still TODO); i18n PHASE A DONE, enhancements pending (pluralization tests, Intl helpers in use in several places).

### Authentication
- Auth context and login flow scaffolding exist; organization selector mocked; MFA/device trust steps described in planning but not wired to backend.
  - Evidence: `contexts/auth-context.tsx`, `app/login/*`, `lib/auth.ts`.

Status: PARTIAL (mocked). Needs real endpoints, refresh, device trust persistence, tests.

### Testing & QA
- Unit/integration tests exist for leads list, RBAC smoke, protected route, AP/AR, and a CSP shape smoke test.
  - Evidence: `tests/*` including `crm-leads.test.tsx`, `pages-rbac-smoke.test.tsx`, `protected-route.test.tsx`, `accounts-payable.test.tsx`, `accounts-receivable.test.tsx`, `security-headers.test.ts`.

Status: PARTIAL. Broaden coverage (providers, i18n utilities, CRM flows), and add a11y checks.

### Security & headers
- CSP smoke test present but headers not enforced in runtime config.
  - Evidence: `tests/security-headers.test.ts` constructs expected directives; no `next.config.mjs` header injection observed.

Status: TODO (inject headers via Next middleware or config; validate in E2E).

## Cross‑module evidence highlights

- CRM Dashboard KPIs (proxy + fallback): `app/api/crm/dashboard/kpis/route.ts`
- CRM SSE: `app/api/crm/events/route.ts`
- Leads bulk actions: `app/crm/leads/page.tsx` uses `/api/crm/leads/bulk-status`
- Opportunities DnD and stage updates: `app/crm/opportunities/page.tsx` + `/api/crm/opportunities/[id]/stage/route.ts`
- Import templates: `/api/crm/leads/import/template`, `/api/crm/accounts/import/template`
- i18n keys (CRM/Portal/Reports): `locales/en/translation.json`

## Remaining work (prioritized backlog)

1) Auth & RBAC v1
   - Wire login/MFA/refresh/device trust to backend; persist device trust securely.
   - Fetch permissions from server; replace client map; add 403 UX and audit events.
   - Tests for lockout, focus management, permission helpers.

2) CRM completeness
   - Quotes/Orders: implement full detail flows (status transitions, approvals, fulfillment), pagination controls where missing.
   - Global CRM search with saved segments; unify saved views/column chooser across entities.
   - Collaboration: per‑entity activity timelines with mentions/files; tasks with reminders.
   - File uploads service (mock → real) for attachments.

3) Reports & Analytics integration
   - Implement `/api/v1/analytics/*` endpoints consumption in `custom-report-builder.tsx`.
   - Server‑side execution and export; remove alert‑based stubs.

4) Customer Portal backend
   - Replace mocks with `/api/v1/customer-portal/*`; add download endpoints; refine reorder/quote requests.

5) i18n Phase B/C
   - Add pluralization tests, Intl number/date/currency helpers coverage; missing‑key reporter in dev and CI script adoption.

6) Quality, a11y, performance
   - Extend unit/integration tests for core flows (lists, imports, SSE updates).
   - Add a11y checks and keyboard DnD fallback.
   - Skeletons and memoization for large lists; infinite scroll or server pagination uniformly.

7) Security & headers
   - Enforce CSP, security headers in `next.config.mjs` or middleware; verify via tests and in production.

## Completion snapshot (rough, evidence‑based)

- CRM: 60–70% (lists solid; Kanban+SSE present; quotes/orders/details and collab features pending)
- Customer Portal: 80–90% UI (backend wiring pending)
- Reports (Builder UI): 80–90% UI (backend wiring pending)
- Application Shell: 90% (notifications realtime not wired)
- Auth/RBAC: 40–50% (mocked auth; client‑side RBAC only)
- i18n: 80% (Phase A done; governance/tests pending)
- Testing/QA: 25–35% (basic coverage present)
- Security headers: 10% (tests only; no runtime headers)

## Notes on planning documents vs repository

- Some planning files mark modules as 100% complete (e.g., Portal, Custom Report Builder). Based on code review, these are UI‑complete but still require backend integration. This document adjusts those to reflect integration status.
- CRM consolidation plan has been overtaken by actual implementation: the dashboard and several entity pages are implemented and wired to local proxy routes with SSE.

## How to update this document

- Treat `Planning and progress tracking/PROJECT_STATUS_VERIFIED.md` as the single source of truth for progress. When adding features:
  - Link to files and routes you touched.
  - Update the relevant module section and the completion snapshot.
  - Keep “Remaining work” prioritized and actionable.
