# âœ… Master Data Management (MDM) - Audit & Enhancement Plan

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the completed Master Data Management module and outlines the backlog for future enhancements, based on **Prompt #6** from the `ERP_Frontend_Prompt_Collection.md`.

## ðŸ“Š Module Status: Phase 1 Complete & Audited

All core features for Customer and Material master data management have been implemented and verified. The UI is ready for full backend integration and serves as a robust foundation for Phase 2 features.

## âœ… Section 1: Audit Checklist (Phase 1 - Complete)

### Customer Master Interface (`components/customer-master.tsx`)
-   [x] **Master-Detail Layout**: Implemented with a main data table and a slide-out `Sheet` for details.
-   [x] **Advanced Table**: Features column sorting, row selection, and pagination controls.
-   [x] **Search & Basic Filtering**: Implemented search by name/ID and dropdown filters for status and type.
-   [x] **Detail View with Tabs**: Details sheet includes tabs for General, Contacts, Financial, and History.
-   [x] **Status Badges**: Clear, color-coded badges with icons for record status (`active`, `pending`, `inactive`, `rejected`).
-   [x] **Toolbar Actions**: Buttons for `Add Customer`, `Import`, and `Export` are in place.

### Material Master Interface (`components/material-master.tsx`)
-   [x] **Hierarchical Category Browser**: A tree-like navigation component filters materials by category.
-   [x] **Filtered Data Table**: A table displays materials based on the selected category and search term.
-   [x] **Search**: Implemented search by material name/ID.
-   [x] **Toolbar Actions**: Buttons for `Add Material`, `Import`, and `Export` are in place.

### Common MDM Patterns
-   [x] **Centralized Module Entry**: A tabbed interface in `master-data-management.tsx` switches between Customer and Material domains.
-   [x] **Enterprise UI/UX**: Follows design standards using `shadcn/ui` for a professional and consistent feel.
-   [x] **Ready for Integration**: `CURSOR` comments are correctly placed for all required API endpoints.

## ðŸš€ Section 2: Enhancement Backlog (Phase 2)

-   [ ] **Create/Edit Forms**: Implement modals or dedicated pages for creating and editing Customer and Material records.
-   [ ] **Advanced Filtering**: Add a popover with advanced filtering options (e.g., date ranges, credit limits, location).
-   [ ] **Server-Side Operations**: Integrate backend APIs for server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering to handle large datasets.
-   [ ] **Bulk Actions**: Implement the logic for bulk updates (e.g., change status, assign to group) on selected records.
-   [ ] **Data Quality & Governance**:
    -   [ ] Implement a "Data Quality" tab in the detail view with validation scores.
    -   [ ] Develop a duplicate detection and merging workflow.
-   [ ] **Approval Workflows**: Build an interface to visualize and interact with approval chains for new or modified records.
-   [ ] **Full Detail View**: Build out all remaining tabs in the detail sheets (e.g., Documents, Addresses for Customers; BOM, Pricing for Materials).
